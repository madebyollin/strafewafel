## What is Strafewafel?

Strafewafel is a single-file Javascript implementation of dual-stick walk / look controls, intended for smooth, relaxing games (think The Witness or Google Street View, not Quake).

Strafewafel is intended to work well with touch (mobile) and keyboard + mouse interfaces.

## What does Strafewafel do?

Strafewafel translates the user's mouse / keyboard / touch commands into smooth player motion.

It sounds easy but it's actually, like, really finicky.

[Here's a simple test environment](https://madebyollin.github.io/strafewafel/demo-3d/) where you can try it out.
